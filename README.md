# Mentor Recommender System
Worked on developing a mentor recommender system that suggests relevant professors to students based on their queries, such as interests in specific areas (e.g., design).
Its potential impact includes time and resource optimisation, optimized matching and improved learning outcomes for both academic institutions and professional and skill development programmes
We trained BERT for text analysis and vectorized, tokenized and did various pre-processings to speed up the process
